# Firebase Authentication Integration

This document describes the Firebase Authentication integration in the E-testi application.

## Overview

The application now uses Firebase Authentication for user management, replacing the previous mock authentication system.

## Configuration

Firebase is configured with the following project details:
- Project ID: e-testi-523ef
- Auth Domain: e-testi-523ef.firebaseapp.com

## Features Implemented

### 1. Firebase Setup
- Firebase configuration in `src/lib/firebase/config.ts`
- Firebase Auth service in `src/lib/firebase/auth.ts`
- TypeScript types for Firebase user data

### 2. Authentication State Management
- Updated `authAtom.ts` to store Firebase user objects
- Created `useFirebaseAuth` hook for authentication operations
- Integrated with Recoil state management

### 3. AuthModal Integration
- Updated `AuthModal.tsx` to use Firebase Auth instead of mock functions
- Real email/password authentication
- User registration with additional profile data (grade, school)
- Error handling with Albanian translations

### 4. App Integration
- Updated `App.tsx` to use Firebase authentication
- Automatic auth state persistence
- Proper loading states during authentication

## Authentication Flow

### Sign Up Process
1. User enters name, email, password
2. Password validation with requirements
3. User selects grade (9 or 12)
4. User selects school from predefined list
5. Firebase creates user account
6. User profile data stored in auth state

### Sign In Process
1. User enters email and password
2. Firebase authenticates user
3. User data loaded into application state

### Sign Out Process
1. Firebase signs out user
2. Auth state cleared
3. User redirected to landing page

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling with Albanian translations for common Firebase errors:
- Email already in use
- Weak password
- Invalid email
- User not found
- Wrong password
- Too many requests
- Network errors

## State Management

Authentication state is managed through:
- `authAtom`: Recoil atom storing auth state
- `useFirebaseAuth`: Custom hook for auth operations
- `onAuthStateChanged`: Firebase listener for auth state changes

## Security

- Firebase handles all authentication security
- Passwords are validated client-side before submission
- User sessions are managed by Firebase
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage

## Usage

The authentication system is automatically initialized when the app starts. Users can:
- Sign up for new accounts
- Sign in to existing accounts
- Sign out from their accounts
- Have their authentication state persisted across sessions

## Dependencies

- firebase: ^10.x.x (latest)
- recoil: ^0.7.7
- react: ^18.3.1

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/lib/firebase/config.ts`
- `src/lib/firebase/auth.ts`
- `src/lib/firebase/index.ts`
- `src/hooks/useFirebaseAuth.ts`

### Modified Files
- `src/store/atoms/authAtom.ts`
- `src/store/selectors/authSelectors.ts`
- `src/components/forms/AuthModal.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/main.tsx`
- `package.json`

## Testing

To test the authentication:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Click "Fillo falas tani" or "Krijo llogari falas"
3. Try signing up with a new account
4. Try signing in with existing credentials
5. Test sign out functionality

The authentication state will persist across browser refreshes.
